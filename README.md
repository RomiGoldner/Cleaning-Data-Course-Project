This repository hosts the R code and files for the final project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, which is part of the Data Science Specialization Track.

The dataset being used is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

# Files
All the data is stored in the same folder. 

`CodeBook.md` file describes the variable, tranformations or work made, data all in order to clean the data as needed.

`run_analysis.R` is the actual code that preforms the analysis described in the 5 steps. 
The output of the 5 steps is a text file called Tidy.txt (uploaded in the repository).
